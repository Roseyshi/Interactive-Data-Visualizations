# Interactive-Data-Visualizations
The aim of this projects is to create interactive widgets to enhance user interpretation of data visualizations. Before proceeding with this project, install:
  >> SciPy - a python library for scientific computing and visualizations.
  >> ipywidgets - a set of interactive user interface components for jupyter notebooks and jupyter labs allowing fro interactive visualisations and dashboards.
  >> Chart-studio - a web-based platform for creating, editing and sharing plotly charts.
  >> Pyarrow - an open-source cross-language development platform for in-memory data that specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data.
  >> Cufflinks - an extesnion of plotly library that provides a set of high-level functions and tools for creating interactive visualizations directly from Pandas DataFrames.
Interactive widgets that will be developed here will be similar to those of Power BI. However the widgtes we will use for this projects will be more intereactive allowing for flexibility. The user can easily choose the data they require to visualize.
